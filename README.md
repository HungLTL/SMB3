Poorly-implemented remake of one of the best platforming games ever made by an idiot who has absolutely no prior experience to game development and advanced C++. The owner of this repository should be ashamed.

UPDATE v1.2:
- Mario functions fleshed out: Now has the ability to carry koopa shells, charging up jumps and sprints, can now fly properly, and a tail that can identify overlaps instead of collisions
- Added paragoombas, koopa paratroopas and piranha plants
- Certain pipes can now warp to the World 1-1 Secret Zone
- Added power ups, coins, the P-Switch and the End-of-World Roulette
- Added splash screen and overworld map
- Added HUD

Controls:

AD: move left/right
S: crouch (non-normal)
W: warp up (if possible)
I: start game at splash screen
J: attack(fire or raccoon)/sprint/carry
K: jump/fly
